* Usage

1. Start =org-agenda= and execute a custom agenda command to start the prirotization process.
2. Rate each task in order of interest from 1 (least interesting) to 5 (most interesting).
3. Tasks with low disarability are hidden during the next review process. Similarly tasks with a high score, appear more often.
4. If a certain task is particularly appealing: do it immediately and abandon the prioritization effort.

* Installation


* Configuration

You must create a custom agenda command to invoke the SIE priorization process:

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(("r" "SIE" tags-todo "-CANCELLED/"
           ((org-agenda-overriding-header "SIE Review")
            (org-agenda-skip-function 'org-review-agenda-skip)
            (org-agenda-cmp-user-defined 'org-review-compare)
            (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(user-defined-down))
            (org-review-last-property-name org-sie-last-review-property)
            (org-review-next-property-name org-sie-next-review-property)))))
#+end_src
